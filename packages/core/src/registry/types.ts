 *     bridge relocates the box to the proposed drag point, so one descriptor
 *     serves both the static candidate and the moving node.
 *   - `aabb` — an already-resolved XZ bounding box, for kinds whose plan
 *     shape isn't a centred rectangle (stair: a segment chain or annular
 *     sector). The moving-anchor bridge can relocate these by patching the
 *     proposed plan position and resolving the AABB again.

 * its footprint (a straight stair walks its `stair-segment` children); box
 * kinds derive everything from `node` alone.
